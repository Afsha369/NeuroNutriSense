Behavioural assessments were carried out to investigate the effectiveness of combo drug and
methanol extract in MPTP induced PD mice models. Locomotor and Rotarod activity was
significantly increased on 14th, 21st, 28th day in MPTP mice models treated with combo-drug and
Methanol Extract.      

<br>

Based upon the behavioural performance of the MPTP models, we can conclude that combo-
drug containing l-dopa and ceftriaxone, which was designed and developed in our present
studies, has shown effect in PD models. It simultaneously enhances the dopamine synthesis and
also inhibits the aggregation of misfolded protein into lewy bodies in the brain. Effect of combo-
drug on Locomotor activity and Rotarod activity was found to be increasing in MPTP models.
Next to the Combo drug, Methanolic extract of Mucuna pruriens was also found to be more
effective than l-dopa in MPTP mice models.
